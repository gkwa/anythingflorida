I'll give you a recipe and a url and you do the following steps:

Create a neo4j cypher query that creates a recipe node that has a title and url.  Here's an example:
CREATE (yellowThaiCurry:Recipe { name: "Yellow Thai Curry", urls: ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaB3T4HpGE8"]})
CREATE (thaiCurry1:Recipe { name: "The Best Green Curry", urls: ["https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/easy-authentic-thai-green-curry", "https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMJV_m1w-qezTjSZAmu6Vam_PKMR6GICW6TJ883"]})

Also you should fetch the ingredients from the recipe and from each
ingredient, take note of the quantitiy for the ingredient and save it
for the relation below, but in the product remove the quantity

next, camelcase the product name and create cypher query to create
node from product name. Here's an example:

CREATE (thaiBasil:Product { name: "Thai basil" ,urls: ["https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/simple-truth-organic-thai-basil/0001111001922"]}, type: "Basil")
CREATE (thaiChilies:Product { name: "Thai chilies", type: "Chilies" })
CREATE (thaiEggplant:Product { name: "Thai Eggplant", type: "Eggplant" })

For each product node you created, create an additional relation that
indicates that this recipe contains these products. In the relation,
add the quantity that you took not of.  Here's an example

CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "1 bunch" }]->(cilantro)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "3/4 cup" }]->(chickenStock)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "1 lb" }]->(chickenThigh)

where here thaiCurry1 is the recipe and chickenStock is an ingredient

Also create an person node similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant:Person { name: "Pailin Chongchitnant", urls: [""] })

If you find the chef in the data that created this recipe, the create
a relation that tells us who CREATED the recipe similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant)-[:CREATED]->(teriyakiRecipe)

If you're about to create a cypher query like this where the urls list is empty:
CREATE (palmSugar:Product { name: "Palm sugar", type: "Palm sugar", urls: [""] })

then just leave out the urls list all together...so instead you should create the entry like this:
CREATE (palmSugar:Product { name: "Palm sugar", type: "Palm sugar" })

Always use double quotes to delimit fields instead of single quotes.

Put all your results and cypher code in a single code block.

Ok here goes.

White or brown basmati rice, to serve*
1 yellow onion
2 medium bell peppers (we used 1 yellow and 1 orange)
1 large garlic clove
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 cups (5 ounces) baby spinach leaves (or chopped spinach)
28-ounce can crushed fire roasted tomatoes (or best quality crushed tomatoes)**

1 teaspoon cumin
3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 15-ounce can chickpeas
1 cup frozen peas
3/4 cup full fat coconut milk
Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark
Instructions
Cook the rice: If serving with rice, start the basmati rice (or use an Instant Pot.)
Prep the vegetables: Dice the onion and bell peppers. (For super speed, you can go to Step 3 and mince the garlic and ginger while they cook.) Mince the garlic. Peel and mince the ginger (or grate it).
Saute the veggies: In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and peppers saute for 5 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, and spinach and saute for 2 minutes until the spinach is fully wilted.
Simmer: Carefully pour in the crushed tomatoes and their juices, then add the curry powder, cumin, salt, chickpeas, peas, and coconut milk. Cook for 5 minutes until bubbly. Remove from the heat. If desired, stir in a little more coconut milk (depending on the tomato brand*). Serve with rice.



Notes
*Or make the rice in advance, which is helpful for brown rice because it takes longer to cook. To reheat the rice, place it in a pan on the stovetop and add a splash of water. Heat gently for a few minutes until the water evaporates and the rice is warmed through.

**Fire roasted tomatoes are a special type of canned tomato that’s become widely available at most grocery stores. If you can’t find them, use the best quality tomatoes you can. All brands vary widely: we’ve found that some can be rather thick, so in that case we stir in a little more coconut milk at the end.
