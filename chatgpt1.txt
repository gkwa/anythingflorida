I'll give you a recipe and a url and you do the following steps:

Create a neo4j cypher query that creates a recipe node that has a title and url.  Here's an example:
CREATE (yellowThaiCurry:Recipe { name: "Yellow Thai Curry", urls: ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaB3T4HpGE8"]})
CREATE (thaiCurry1:Recipe { name: "The Best Green Curry", urls: ["https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/easy-authentic-thai-green-curry", "https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMJV_m1w-qezTjSZAmu6Vam_PKMR6GICW6TJ883"]})

Also you should fetch the ingredients from the recipe and from each
ingredient, take note of the quantitiy for the ingredient and save it
for the relation below, but in the product remove the quantity

next, camelcase the product name and create cypher query to create
node from product name. Here's an example:

CREATE (thaiBasil:Product { name: "Thai basil" ,urls: ["https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/simple-truth-organic-thai-basil/0001111001922"]}, type: "Basil")
CREATE (thaiChilies:Product { name: "Thai chilies", type: "Chilies" })
CREATE (thaiEggplant:Product { name: "Thai Eggplant", type: "Eggplant" })

For each product node you created, create an additional relation that
indicates that this recipe contains these products. In the relation,
add the quantity that you took not of.  Here's an example

CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "1 bunch" }]->(cilantro)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "3/4 cup" }]->(chickenStock)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "1 lb" }]->(chickenThigh)

where here thaiCurry1 is the recipe and chickenStock is an ingredient

Also create an person node similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant:Person { name: "Pailin Chongchitnant", urls: [""] })

If you find the chef in the data that created this recipe, the create
a relation that tells us who CREATED the recipe similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant)-[:CREATED]->(teriyakiRecipe)

If you're about to create a cypher query like this where the urls list is empty:
CREATE (palmSugar:Product { name: "Palm sugar", type: "Palm sugar", urls: [""] })

then just leave out the urls list all together...so instead you should create the entry like this:
CREATE (palmSugar:Product { name: "Palm sugar", type: "Palm sugar" })

Always use double quotes to delimit fields instead of single quotes.

Put all your results and cypher code in a single code block.

Ok here goes.

Instructions
How to Make Spring Rolls:
Boil Shrimp according to our boiled shrimp recipe then immediately cool in ice water. Once boiled and cooled, drain and cut shrimp in half lengthwise.
Cook noodles according to package instructions until softened (do not overcook) then drain in a colander and rinse with cold water. Let noodles drain in a colander until ready to assemble. You can also fill a saucepan with water and bring it to a boil, add the noodles, turn off the heat and let them sit in hot water for 5-7 minutes.
Prep veggies - julienne cucumbers and carrots, remove stiff stems on lettuce leaves, coarsely chop cilantro,
Assemble spring rolls One at a Time. Fill a shallow round bowl (wider than your wrappers) with very warm/hot water. Submerge spring roll wrapper for about 10-15 seconds or until softened(depending on the temperature of your water). Place wet spring roll wrapper on a clean and lightly wet cutting board.
Add veggies on one half in this order: lettuce, a generous pinch of noodles, carrots, cucumber, cilantro sprigs.
Add shrimp on the second half, placing the shrimp cut-side up.
Tightly roll up the lettuce side first, tuck in the sides then roll over the shrimp so shrimp are visible on the outside.
To serve - Transfer finished rolls to a serving platter and keep finished spring rolls covered with a damp kitchen towel so they do not dry out. For a prettier presentation, serve cut in half on the diagonal.
How to Make Vietnamese Dipping Sauce:
In a small mixing bowl, combine all dipping sauce ingredients, adding sugar and sesame oil (if using), to taste. 
How to Make Peanut Dipping Sauce:
In a mason jar, combine dressing and peanut butter, cover tightly with lid and shake until smooth and well combined. 
Notes
Note: The nutrition label is for 1 spring roll without the sauce.
