I'll give you a recipe and a url and you do the following steps:

Create a neo4j cypher query that creates a recipe node that has a title and url.  Here's an example:
CREATE (yellowThaiCurry:Recipe { name: 'Yellow Thai Curry', urls: ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaB3T4HpGE8']})
CREATE (thaiCurry1:Recipe { name: "The Best Green Curry", urls: ["https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/easy-authentic-thai-green-curry", "https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMJV_m1w-qezTjSZAmu6Vam_PKMR6GICW6TJ883"]})

Also you should fetch the ingredients from the recipe and from each
ingredient, take note of the quantitiy for the ingredient and save it
for the relation below, but in the product remove the quantity

next, camelcase the product name and create cypher query to create
node from product name. Here's an example:

CREATE (thaiBasil:Product { name: "Thai basil" ,urls: ["https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/simple-truth-organic-thai-basil/0001111001922"]})
CREATE (thaiChilies:Product { name: "Thai chilies"})
CREATE (thaiEggplant:Product { name: "Thai Eggplant" })

For each product node you created, create an additional relation that
indicates that this recipe contains these products. In the relation,
add the quantity that you took not of.  Here's an example

CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '1 bunch' }]->(cilantro)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '3/4 cup' }]->(chickenStock)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '1 lb' }]->(chickenThigh)

where here thaiCurry1 is the recipe and chickenStock is an ingredient

Ingredients
500 grams Boneless Chicken Thighs cut into thin strips
2 tablespoon Oil
4 tablespoon Red Curry Paste (ref not 1)
½ Onion sliced
½ tablespoon Garlic minced
1 teaspoon Ginger minced
½ tablespoon Coriander Stem minced
1 stalk Lemon grass (ref notes - 2)
2 teaspoon Fish Sauce
½ tablespoon Light Brown Sugar
1 Red Bell Pepper cut into wedges
1 cup Zucchini cut
1.5 cup Coconut Milk full fat
½ cup Stock / Water
2 teaspoon Lemon Juice
8-10 leaves Thai Basil roughly torn
Instructions
Heat oil in a skillet. Add sliced onion, minced ginger, and garlic. Saute for a minute until it is aromatic.
Add red curry paste and minced coriander root. Saute for 2-3 minutes until oil starts oozing out on the side, and the mixture is aromatic.
Add coconut milk, stock, lemon zest, brown sugar, fish sauce, and lemongrass stalk. Mix well and let everything come to a boil. Simmer and let it cook for 2-3 minutes.
Add chicken and let it simmer for 7-8 minutes.
Add the veggies when the chicken is almost cooked/ and the sauce has reduced almost by half (or to the consistency you are looking for).
Cook for another 2 minutes, until the veggies are just cooked but still have a crunch to them.
Remove the lemongrass stalk, Add torn Thai basil.
Serve over rice with more garnishing of basil and fresh coriander leaves.
Notes
Store-bought curry paste is very intense, so 4-5 tablespoons of curry paste work the best. Suppose using fresh curry paste use from 1/2 - 3/4 cup of curry paste.
 Red curry paste might be on the spicier side for some brands. So if you have low spice tolerance, start with 2 tablespoons of curry paste, taste, and add more if required. 
It's easy to crush a stalk of lemongrass(only the white part) to add flavor to the curry. Instead, you can use roughly 1 teaspoon of readymade lemongrass paste or fresh lemongrass paste. 
Add up to 2 cups of veggies. You can use chopped squash, green beans, or snow peas as well to the curry. 
Try to use full-fat coconut milk for a rich and creamy sauce. 
You can adjust the seasoning to your liking by adding more fish sauce or sugar to the sauce.
