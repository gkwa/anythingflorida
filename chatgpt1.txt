I'll give you a recipe and a url and you do the following steps:

Create a neo4j cypher query that creates a recipe node that has a title and url.  Here's an example:
CREATE (yellowThaiCurry:Recipe { name: 'Yellow Thai Curry', urls: ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaB3T4HpGE8']})
CREATE (thaiCurry1:Recipe { name: "The Best Green Curry", urls: ["https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/easy-authentic-thai-green-curry", "https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMJV_m1w-qezTjSZAmu6Vam_PKMR6GICW6TJ883"]})

Also you should fetch the ingredients from the recipe and from each
ingredient, take note of the quantitiy for the ingredient and save it
for the relation below, but in the product remove the quantity

next, camelcase the product name and create cypher query to create
node from product name. Here's an example:

CREATE (thaiBasil:Product { name: "Thai basil" ,urls: ["https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/simple-truth-organic-thai-basil/0001111001922"]}, type: "Basil")
CREATE (thaiChilies:Product { name: "Thai chilies", type: "Chilies" })
CREATE (thaiEggplant:Product { name: "Thai Eggplant", type: "Eggplant" })

For each product node you created, create an additional relation that
indicates that this recipe contains these products. In the relation,
add the quantity that you took not of.  Here's an example

CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '1 bunch' }]->(cilantro)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '3/4 cup' }]->(chickenStock)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '1 lb' }]->(chickenThigh)

where here thaiCurry1 is the recipe and chickenStock is an ingredient

Also create an author node similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant:Person { name: 'Pailin Chongchitnant', urls: [""] })

YIELD
3 cups
To cook the tomatillos, you can either roast them in the oven, brown them on the stovetop, or boil them. Roasting in the oven or browning on the stovetop will deliver more flavor. Each way works, though boiling is a more common way to cook the tomatillos.

Garlic is optional. You can either cook a few cloves with the tomatillos in any of these steps, or add one or two raw garlic cloves when you go to blend the salsa.

Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds tomatillos (about 12 medium)

1/2 cup chopped white onion

2 cloves (or more) garlic, optional
