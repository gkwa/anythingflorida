I'll give you a recipe and a url and you do the following steps:

Create a neo4j cypher query that creates a recipe node that has a title and url.  Here's an example:
CREATE (yellowThaiCurry:Recipe { name: "Yellow Thai Curry", urls: ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaB3T4HpGE8"]})
CREATE (thaiCurry1:Recipe { name: "The Best Green Curry", urls: ["https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/easy-authentic-thai-green-curry", "https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMJV_m1w-qezTjSZAmu6Vam_PKMR6GICW6TJ883"]})

Also you should fetch the ingredients from the recipe and from each
ingredient, take note of the quantitiy for the ingredient and save it
for the relation below, but in the product remove the quantity

next, camelcase the product name and create cypher query to create
node from product name. Here's an example:

CREATE (thaiBasil:Product { name: "Thai basil" ,urls: ["https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/simple-truth-organic-thai-basil/0001111001922"]}, type: "Basil")
CREATE (thaiChilies:Product { name: "Thai chilies", type: "Chilies" })
CREATE (thaiEggplant:Product { name: "Thai Eggplant", type: "Eggplant" })

For each product node you created, create an additional relation that
indicates that this recipe contains these products. In the relation,
add the quantity that you took not of.  Here's an example

CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "1 bunch" }]->(cilantro)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "3/4 cup" }]->(chickenStock)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "1 lb" }]->(chickenThigh)

where here thaiCurry1 is the recipe and chickenStock is an ingredient

Also create an person node similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant:Person { name: "Pailin Chongchitnant", urls: [""] })

If you find the chef in the data that created this recipe, the create
a relation that tells us who CREATED the recipe similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant)-[:CREATED]->(teriyakiRecipe)

If you're about to create a cypher query like this where the urls list is empty:
CREATE (palmSugar:Product { name: "Palm sugar", type: "Sweeteners", urls: [""] })

then just leave out the urls list all together...so instead you should create the entry like this:
CREATE (palmSugar:Product { name: "Palm sugar", type: "Sweeteners" })

Always use double quotes to delimit fields instead of single quotes.

Put all your results and cypher code in a single code block.

Farro Salad with Artichoke Hearts
Close
Print
Farro is a variety of wheat commonly enjoyed as a whole grain in Italy. Similar to bulgur, it contains thiamine, niacin, selenium and magnesium, all essential nutrients that support good health.

Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups semi-pearled farro
2 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
1 jar (14 oz.)  artichoke hearts
6 Tbs. red wine vinegar
3 Tbs. olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped red onion, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted
Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
Directions:
Rinse the farro and drain. In a saucepan over high heat, combine the farro and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the grains are tender and the water is absorbed, about 25 minutes.

Drain the sun-dried tomatoes; if desired, reserve the oil to use in place of some of the olive oil. Cut the tomatoes into julienne. Drain, rinse and quarter the artichokes.

In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar and olive oil. Add the cooked farro, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, onion, parsley and pine nuts and stir until well combined. Season generously with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.
