I'll give you a recipe and a url and you do the following steps:

Create a neo4j cypher query that creates a recipe node that has a title and url.  Here's an example:
CREATE (yellowThaiCurry:Recipe { name: 'Yellow Thai Curry', urls: ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaB3T4HpGE8']})
CREATE (thaiCurry1:Recipe { name: "The Best Green Curry", urls: ["https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/easy-authentic-thai-green-curry", "https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMJV_m1w-qezTjSZAmu6Vam_PKMR6GICW6TJ883"]})

Also you should fetch the ingredients from the recipe and from each
ingredient, take note of the quantitiy for the ingredient and save it
for the relation below, but in the product remove the quantity

next, camelcase the product name and create cypher query to create
node from product name. Here's an example:

CREATE (thaiBasil:Product { name: "Thai basil" ,urls: ["https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/simple-truth-organic-thai-basil/0001111001922"]})
CREATE (thaiChilies:Product { name: "Thai chilies"})
CREATE (thaiEggplant:Product { name: "Thai Eggplant" })

For each product node you created, create an additional relation that
indicates that this recipe contains these products. In the relation,
add the quantity that you took not of.  Here's an example

CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '1 bunch' }]->(cilantro)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '3/4 cup' }]->(chickenStock)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: '1 lb' }]->(chickenThigh)

where here thaiCurry1 is the recipe and chickenStock is an ingredient

Ok here goes:

Sugar Snap Pea and Carrot Soba Noodles
Author: Cookie and Kate Prep Time: 25 mins Cook Time: 5 mins Total Time: 30 minutes Yield: 6 1x Category: Main Cuisine: Asian
★★★★★ 4.8 from 67 reviews
A healthy, vibrant soba noodle recipe full of fresh springtime produce. Feel free to trade in other seasonal vegetables for the sugar snap peas, like chopped bell pepper. This recipe yields about six servings and the leftovers don’t keep particularly well, so halve the ingredients if you’re not serving a crowd.

Sugar snap pea and carrot soba noodles recipe
SCALE

INGREDIENTS
Soba
6 ounces soba noodles or spaghetti noodles of choice
2 cups frozen organic edamame
10 ounces (about 3 cups) sugar snap peas or snow peas
6 medium-sized carrots, peeled
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (about 2 handfuls)
1/4 cup sesame seeds
Ginger-sesame sauce
1/4 cup reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
2 tablespoons quality peanut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
1 small lime, juiced
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon honey or agave nectar
1 tablespoon white miso*
2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce or sriracha

INSTRUCTIONS
To prepare the vegetables: Use a chef’s knife to slice the peas in half lengthwise (or just roughly chop them). Slice the carrots into long, thin strips with a julienne peeler, or slice them into ribbons with a vegetable peeler.
To make the sauce: whisk together the ingredients in a small bowl until emulsified. Set aside.
Bring two big pots of water to a boil. In the meantime, toast the sesame seeds: Pour the sesame seeds into a small pan. Toast for about 4 to 5 minutes over medium-low heat, shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning, until the seeds are turning golden and starting to make popping noises.
Once the pots of water are boiling: In one pot, cook the soba noodles just until al dente, according to package directions (probably about 5 minutes), then drain and briefly rinse under cool water. Cook the frozen edamame in the other pot until warmed through (about 4 to 6 minutes) but before draining, toss the halved peas into the boiling edamame water and cook for an additional 20 seconds. Drain.
Combine the soba noodles, edamame, snap peas and carrots in a large serving bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss with salad servers. Toss in the chopped cilantro and toasted sesame seeds. Serve.
NOTES
*I used Miso Master brand’s reduced-sodium sweet white miso. It’s in the refrigerated section near the tofu. Omit if you can’t find it, but it provides a nice boost of flavor.
Make it vegan: Sub agave nectar for the honey.
Make it gluten free: Buy certified gluten-free, all buckwheat soba noodles (or gluten-free spaghetti) and use tamari instead of regular soy sauce. Make sure your miso is gluten free, if using.
Storage suggestions: This dish keeps decently well, covered and refrigerated, for a couple of days, BUT here’s a better way, courtesy of Janet: make a batch, store the salad and dressing separately until ready to eat, and then grab one or two portions and add some dressing. Either way, you can serve leftovers chilled or gently rewarmed. Wake up leftovers with a dash of additional tamari or lime juice and fresh cilantro leaves.
Change it up: Feel free to substitute other seasonal produce for the sugar snap peas, or skip them altogether for less prep work. Chopped, raw bell pepper would be a nice addition this summer.
Recommended equipment: This julienne peeler is a fun tool that turns carrots (and zucchini and cucumbers) into thin vegetable noodles.
