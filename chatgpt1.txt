I'll give you a recipe and a url and you do the following steps:

Create a neo4j cypher query that creates a recipe node that has a title and url.  Here's an example:
CREATE (yellowThaiCurry:Recipe { name: "Yellow Thai Curry", urls: ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaB3T4HpGE8"]})
CREATE (thaiCurry1:Recipe { name: "The Best Green Curry", urls: ["https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/easy-authentic-thai-green-curry", "https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMJV_m1w-qezTjSZAmu6Vam_PKMR6GICW6TJ883"]})

Also you should fetch the ingredients from the recipe and from each
ingredient, take note of the quantitiy for the ingredient and save it
for the relation below, but in the product remove the quantity

next, camelcase the product name and create cypher query to create
node from product name. Here's an example:

CREATE (thaiBasil:Product { name: "Thai basil" ,urls: ["https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/simple-truth-organic-thai-basil/0001111001922"]}, type: "Basil")
CREATE (thaiChilies:Product { name: "Thai chilies", type: "Chilies" })
CREATE (thaiEggplant:Product { name: "Thai Eggplant", type: "Eggplant" })

For each product node you created, create an additional relation that
indicates that this recipe contains these products. In the relation,
add the quantity that you took not of.  Here's an example

CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "1 bunch" }]->(cilantro)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "3/4 cup" }]->(chickenStock)
CREATE (thaiCurry1)-[:CONTAINS { quantity: "1 lb" }]->(chickenThigh)

where here thaiCurry1 is the recipe and chickenStock is an ingredient

Also create an person node similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant:Person { name: "Pailin Chongchitnant", urls: [""] })

If you find the chef in the data that created this recipe, the create
a relation that tells us who CREATED the recipe similar to this:
CREATE (pailinChongchitnant)-[:CREATED]->(teriyakiRecipe)

If you're about to create a cypher query like this where the urls list is empty:
CREATE (palmSugar:Product { name: "Palm sugar", type: "Sweeteners", urls: [""] })

then just leave out the urls list all together...so instead you should create the entry like this:
CREATE (palmSugar:Product { name: "Palm sugar", type: "Sweeteners" })

Always use double quotes to delimit fields instead of single quotes.

Put all your results and cypher code in a single code block.

Ok here goes.

INGREDIENTS
2 bundles (200g) soba noodles
shredded seaweed, toasted sesame flakes for garnish, optional
green onion, grated daikon, wasabi, and/or egg yolk for the dipping sauce, optional
Dipping sauce
1 cup dashi see notes below
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup mirin
1 tbsp sugar or to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Add dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar into a saucepan and mix to combine. Once the mixture comes to a boil, remove from heat and place in the fridge or freezer to cool.
Cook noodles according to package instructions. Drain the noodles in a strainer and rinse under cold running water to remove the excess starch. Shake well to drain, transfer to a plate, and garnish to your preference.
Pour the dipping sauce into a bowl and dress to your liking. Dip a portion of the noodles in the sauce and enjoy!
NOTES
To prepare dashi, add 1/2 tsp of instant dashi powder with 1 cup of water and mix to combine. You can also use low-sodium chicken stock, or use a 2:1 ratio of regular chicken stock and water. 
The dipping sauce is good for up to 2 weeks in the fridge when stored in an airtight container. If you prefer the sauce to be extra cold, place it in the freezer for a few minutes before serving or add a few ice cubes to the sauce.
